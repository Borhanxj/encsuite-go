# Encryption Suite in Go

A structured, step-by-step implementation of classic and modern cryptographic techniques in Go.

## Features

- **Symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms**
- **Key generation** (with QRNG integration planned)
- **Secure hashing functions**
- **Clean, modular, and professional code organization**

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive yet educational cryptography toolkit,  
with each feature developed in isolated **micro-steps** for clarity and reproducibility.
